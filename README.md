# FLASH

## What is FLASH?

FLASH is a package to perform Bayesian optimization on tuning data analytic pipelines. Specifically, it is a two-layer Bayesian optimization framework, which first uses a parametric model to select promising algorithms, then computes a nonparametric model to fine-tune hyperparameters of the promising algorithms. It is developed on top of [HPOlib](https://github.com/automl/HPOlib), a general platform for hyperparameter optimization.
