# FLASH: Fast Bayesian Optimization for Data Analytic Pipelines 

FLASH is a package for tuning data analytic pipelines. Specifically, it is a two-layer Bayesian optimization framework, which first uses a parametric model to select promising algorithms, then computes a nonparametric model to fine-tune hyperparameters of the promising algorithms.
